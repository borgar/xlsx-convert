# XLSX-convert

This is a Node.js utility to convert Excel XLSX files to JSON format. It supports only XLSX files and outputs JSF (JSON spreadsheet format), a variant of CSF ([see below](#output)).

This utility was developed as tooling for [GRID â€“ The new face of spreadsheets](https://grid.is/), to which it owes a debt of gratitude.


## Installing

The library is also provided as an NPM package:

    $ npm install @borgar/xlsx-convert


## Usage


```js
// import the converter
import xlsxConvert from '@borgar/xlsx-convert';

// read the file
const jsf = await xlsxConvert('path/to/workbook.xlsx', options);

// emit results
console.log(jsf);
```

This will emit a structure like this:

```js
{
  "filename": "workbook.xlsx",
  "sheets": [
    {
      "cells": {
        "A1": { "v": 12 },
        "B1": { "v": 123.1 },
        "A2": { "v": "Total" },
        "B2": { "v": 135.1, "f": "SUM(A1:B1)", },
      },
      "merges": [],
      "colWidths": [],
      "rowHeights": [],
      "hidden": 0,
      "name": "Sheet1"
    }
  ],
  "names": [],
  "styles": [
    { "font-size": 12 }
  ]
}
```

### <a name="output" href="#output">#</a> Output:

The JSON spreadsheet format is similar to, but not 100% compatible with the [CSF structure](https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs#common-spreadsheet-format) emitted by the [`xlsx` package](https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs). Supported cell properties are:

| Cell. | Note |
|- |-
| `v` | Value of the cell in its correct type.
| `f` | An integer index into a list of formula expressions in R1C1-syntax, or an expression string in A1-syntax.
| `F` | The A1-style range of enclosing array if the formula is an array formula.
| `c` | A list of comments attached to the cell.
| `s` (optional) | Index of style information associated with the cell.
| `t` (optional) | A type for the value in the cell (this library only emits an `"e"` when the value is an error).
| `l` (optional) | A URL attached to the cell.

Only cells that have "relevant data" are emitted, which in praxis means cells that have such things as values, formula, and visible styles attached to them.
